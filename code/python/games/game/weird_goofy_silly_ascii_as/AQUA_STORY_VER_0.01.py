#silly
gru = """Felonious Gru ‚Äì Tactical Mastermind, Minion Commander, and Unexpected Family Man
Ah, greetings. I am Gru‚Äîformer supervillain, expert strategist, and now, a reluctant yet devoted father. My name has been whispered in fear across villainous circles, mostly due to my reputation for audacious heists, unconventional problem-solving, and my unpredictable army of Minions.
At one time, my life revolved around stealing great treasures, crafting elaborate schemes, and perfecting my villainous monologue delivery. My most legendary triumph? Stealing the Moon, an achievement unmatched in history. I held the celestial body in the palm of my hand‚Äîuntil, unfortunately, physics and other annoying factors forced me to return it.

Former Occupation: Supervillain
- Successfully stole the Moon (briefly)
- Attempted to outdo rival supervillain Vector (success is debatable)
- Commanded an entire legion of Minions, a feat requiring near-supernatural patience
- Built a villain lair that was as terrifying as it was highly impractical

Current Status: Anti-Villain League Agent & Full-Time Father
Yes, my grand ambitions for world domination have since been adjusted. I now dedicate my strategic genius to stopping villains even more ridiculous than I once was, thanks to my forced recruitment by the Anti-Villain League.
This has also led to an unexpected partnership with Lucy Wilde, a frustratingly competent AVL agent who, despite all logic, found my personality charming. She is now my wife, meaning that my life remains entirely unpredictable.

The Children: My Greatest (and Most Chaotic) Challenge
My life took an unexpected detour when three small humans entered it‚ÄîMargo, Edith, and Agnes. At first, their presence was nothing more than a strategic deception to further my villainous goals. But, as fate would have it, I became a father‚Äîsomething even more challenging than orchestrating an international crime spree.
Difficult negotiations now revolve around bedtimes, school events, and an ongoing debate about unicorn ownership.
Despite all of this‚Äîdespite the absurdity of my situation, the constant chaos, and the fact that my house is never quiet for more than 30 seconds‚ÄîI find that I would not trade it for anything.

The Minions: My Wildly Unpredictable Army
Ah, the Minions. Small, yellow, excitable beyond comprehension, and utterly chaotic.
While their intelligence is questionable at best, their enthusiasm for destruction is unrivaled. A simple task such as ‚Äúbuild a laser‚Äù might result in a banana-powered singing device, and an order to clean the lab could somehow burn down an entire kitchen (which was not even part of the lab).
Despite their manic tendencies, they are loyal beyond reason. They have been with me through triumph, failure, and several legally questionable situations that I will not elaborate on.

Top 5 Most Chaotic Minion Incidents
- Accidentally set fire to my kitchen while attempting to toast a single slice of bread
- Created an explosive device while trying to make a birthday cake
- Mistook a top-secret AVL communication device for a karaoke microphone (mission: compromised)
- Hijacked my car to turn it into a submarine (without telling me)
- Managed to launch a Minion into orbit during an experiment gone terribly wrong

Signature Gadgets
üîπ Freeze Ray ‚Äì My greatest invention. Ideal for stopping enemies‚Ä¶ or keeping drinks chilled..
üîπ Shrink Ray ‚Äì Briefly used to steal the Moon; results varied.
üîπ Despicamobile ‚Äì Formerly a villainous getaway vehicle, now mostly used for school pickup duty.

My Personal Motto
"Life is full of disappointments. Otherwise, it wouldn‚Äôt be life."
Though my days of villainy are behind me, I find that life is still an unpredictable mess, much like my Minions. And frankly, I wouldn‚Äôt have it any other way.
Now, if you will excuse me, I must prevent Agnes from attempting to adopt yet another unicorn and ensure that my Minions have not burned down the kitchen again."""
