some silly guy called a thing that makes python a .exe pyinstaller
this is instructions for that
it should already be in this enviroment
in your terminal, type:
cd path/to/your/script
then type:
pyinstaller --onefile my_script.py

put --windowed after --onefile if you want a one without a terminal appearing before the .exe runs

apparently makes it more professional
your .exe will be in the dist folder
move the .exe then delete the build, spec, and dist folders afterwards
we should all make effort to be clean :)

this smiley face looks extra happy in this font
